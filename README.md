# chennaiTransitMap_Operational
This is a comprehensive map of Chennai's Transit system.

Note: This is not an official map.

The map includes Chennai Metro, Chennai Suburban, Chennai MRTS lines. I've also included the important bus stops.


The map is quite big, and text size, color are tailored to be viewed zoomed in. The JPEG and PDF file in this repo are of great quality, and the intricate details of the map can be viewed by zooming in. But if the map is shared as JPEG in social media, it might lose quality due to compression, and the user won't be able to read it's content as intended. I suggest sharing this link or make sure to share as uncompressed files to make sure the content of the map is readable.

Please mail me at karthikeyan14june@gmail.com if you find any corrections, or if you have any suggestions on improvement. Please understand that designing a transit map requires me to take few creative decisions, like sticking to only 45, 90 and 180 degree lines. This is to make the map as clean and simple as possible for the eyes. This decision leads to few inaccuracies when compared with actual geographic map, and is intented. This map prioritises ease of view and accuracy of transit lines/names, over accuracy of geography.

I'll keep this repo updated with the latest map, with the most accurate info possible.

Thanks!
